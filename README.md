# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of the Analysis

During this analysis, we helped the company PyBer, a Python-based ridesharing app company, to get clean and better understandable data from a couple of different CSV files which contained information such as cities and their types, date, ride id, driver count, and the different fares that are charged. The goal of this analysis is to create a variety of charts (bar, bubble, scatterplot, etc) to finally give the company a multiple-line chart with the information that will let them improve access to ridesharing services and determine affordability for underserved neighborhoods.

After doing this analysis, we could gather a lot of valuable information that will definitely help PyBer to become one of the best ridesharing app companies by using resources such as data analysis.

## Results

Using the information from the CSV files such as the different kind of cities (Urban, Suburban, Rural) and the date range (January 2019 to April 2019), we can represent in graphs the following data.

- From the total amount of rides (2,375) we are able to show that the Urban cities are the one that more rides represent, overcoming by having a total of 1,625 rides while the Suburban and Rural cities have  a total amount of rides of 625 and 125 respectively.
