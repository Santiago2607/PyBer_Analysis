# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of the Analysis

During this analysis, we helped the company PyBer, a Python-based ridesharing app company, to get clean and better understandable data from a couple of different CSV files which contained information such as cities and their types, date, ride id, driver count, and the different fares that are charged. The goal of this analysis is to create a variety of charts (bar, bubble, scatterplot, etc) to finally give the company a multiple-line chart with the information that will let them improve access to ridesharing services and determine affordability for underserved neighborhoods.

After doing this analysis, we could gather a lot of valuable information that will definitely help PyBer to become one of the best ridesharing app companies by using resources such as data analysis.

## Results

Using the information from the CSV files such as the different kinds of cities (Urban, Suburban, Rural) and the date range (January 2019 to April 2019), we can represent in graphs and with percentages on it the following data.

- From the total amount of rides (2,375) we are able to show that the Urban cities are the ones that more rides represent to the company, having a total of 1,625 rides while the Suburban and Rural cities have a total amount of rides of 625 and 125 respectively.

- Furthermore, taking into consideration that the amount of drivers is of great importance for a company to have success, we calculated the total amount of drivers by city type and as a result, Urban cities have a total amount of 2,405 drivers, Suburban cities a total amount of 490, and Rural cities a total amount of 78.

- In addition, since the number of drivers and the number of rides is greater in Urban cities than in any other type of city, the total fares that the company gets from those cities are also considerably higher than from Suburban and Rural cities. According to our analysis, the total fare the company gets from Urban cities is $39,854.38, from Suburban cities is $19,356.33, and from Rural cities is $4,327.93.

Despite the fact that everything pointed out Urban cities are the best market for PyBer, this also has a lot to do with the average fare per ride and the average fare per driver. 
Based on our analysis, the average fare per ride in the Urban, Suburban, and Rural cities is $24.53, $30.97, and $34.62 respectively. Also, the average fare per driver in the Urban, Suburban, and Rural cities is $16.57,  $39.50, and $55.49 respectively as well. 
With this information, we can demonstrate that Urban cities are so far the best market for PyBer and Rural cities the least, due to the differences in fare by ride and driver.
